Added an interventions table and form to a group project. 
In App>Views>Interventions>_form.html.erb on line 127 if you remove: 
model: intervention,
the form will seed the database, but the logic behind the form to relate the customer to the corresponding building, battery, column and elevator will not funciton. 
The form is visible in http://localhost:3000/interventions when your rails server is running.
